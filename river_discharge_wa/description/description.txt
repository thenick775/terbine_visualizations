This visualization describes the output, or river discharge, of Hutchinson Creek near Acme, Washington, United States.
Water discharge readings at this station are collected using an acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV) located near the source of Hutchinson Creek,
where individual measurements are expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).

In addition to this, air and water temperature measurements are also collected at this site and are expressed in degrees Celsius.

Data from these sensors, spread throughout the state of Washington, provide technical insight into the managing of water supplies, releases,
and diversions in support of fish, farms, and domestic water needs across the state.

Here we can observe the high variation in river discharge from May through October 2020, where these differences can be analyzed for large
and small time periods.

This data can also be used to monitor erosion, predict and observe flooding events, and many other applications in the realm of the local
water table and civil engineering fields. Where these measurements are correlated with local temperature and storm systems to
illustrate the relationships between weather patterns and current stream conditions.
